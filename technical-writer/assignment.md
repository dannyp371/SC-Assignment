# Debug Options in Kubernetes
This document covers different debugging options available in Kubernetes. Debugging can help improve performance, availability, and reliability in your Kubernetes environments, as well as identify vulnerabilities and errors. Regular audits and debugging can also help prevent future issues from occuring to begin with.
Kubernetes has [their debugging instructions located here](kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster). 
This guide more briefly covers a greater array of debugging options in Kubernetes. These options are largely based around the `kubectl` command, as such, using these options requires using your CLI.

## List Cluster Resources
### `kubectl get`
The first step to debugging anything is knowing the state of items on your cluster. The best way to do this is to list the resources in your cluster. This is done with `kubectl get`. Some `get` examples are given below:

#### `kubectl get pods`
`kubectl get pods` lists all pods in your current namespace. 
```console
kubectl get pods
NAME    READY   STATUS  RESTARTS    AGE
pod1    1/1     Running 0           1m37s
pod2    1/1     Running 0           1m37s
```

Useful options with this command: 
* `-A`: Lists all pods in all namespaces
* `-n <namespace_name>`: Lists all pods in a specific namespace
* `-o wide`: Lists all pods in your current namespace with more information. More generally, `-o` changes the output format of your resource.

#### `kubectl get nodes`
`kubectl get nodes` lists all nodes in your cluster.
```console
kubectl get nodes
NAME    STATUS  ROLES   AGE     VERSION
node1   Ready   <none>  4m45s   v1.31.1
node2   Ready   <none>  4m45s   v1.31.1
```

Useful options with this command:
* `-o wide`: Lists all nodes with more information. More generally, `-o` changes the output format of your resource.

#### `kubectl get services`
`kubectl get services` lists all services in your current namespace.
```console
kubectl get services
NAMESPACE   NAME        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP  EXTERNAL-IP
default     Kubernetes  ClusterIP   10.0.0.1    <none>
NS1         test        ClusterIP   10.0.95.30  <none>    
```

Useful options with this command:
* `-A`: Lists all services in all namespaces

#### `kubectl get events`
`kubectl get events` lists all recent events for resources in your system.
```console
kubectl get events
LAST SEEN   TYPE    REASON      KIND    MESSAGE
12h         Normal  Pulling     Pod     Pulling image "images/testimage"
45m         Warning Failed      Pod     Error: ImagePullBackOff
47m         Normal  Starting    Node    Starting kubelet.
```
Useful options with this command: 
* `-A`: Lists all events in all namespaces
* `--sort-by=<criteria>`: Sorts your options listed by a given criteria. For example, timestamps in order to see your most recent events
* `-o wide`: Lists all events in your current namespace with more information. More generally, `-o` changes the output format of your resource.
* `--field-selector type=Warning`: Lists all Warning events.

The full documentation for `kubectl get` can be [found here](kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_get/).

### `kubectl describe`
Another command used to get more information on your Kubernetes Cluster(s) is `kubectl describe`. This command gives details on a specific resource of group of resources. For instance, after using `kubectl get pods` you found that one of your pods was not running. You could next use `kubectl describe <pod-name>` to find more information on that pod. Some examples are given below:

#### `kubectl describe pod demo-pod`
```console

```

The full documentation for `kubectl describe` can be [found here](kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_describe/).

### `kubectl cluster-info dump`
A final command used to gain information about your cluster is `kubectl cluster-info dump`. This command outputs all relevant information regarding the clusters current state. This includes events, configurations, and logs. It is used to give a broad overview of your cluster's status.

The full documentation for `kubectl cluster-info dump` can be [found here](kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_cluster-info/kubectl_cluster-info_dump/).

## Review your Cluster's Logs
Reviewing logs in your cluster is useful for finding errors while debugging. Logs will often give errors that will explain why a resource in your Kubernetes environment is non-operational. This is used to gain a deeper understanding of why a part of your cluster is non-operational. An example of `kubectl logs` is given below:
```console
kubectl logs --tail=10 demo-node
2024/10/06 17:58:08 [notice] 1#1: start worker process 41
2024/10/06 17:58:08 [notice] 1#1: start worker process 42
2024/10/06 17:58:08 [notice] 1#1: start worker process 43
2024/10/06 17:58:08 [notice] 1#1: start worker process 44
2024/10/06 17:58:08 [notice] 1#1: start worker process 45
2024/10/06 17:58:08 [notice] 1#1: start worker process 46
2024/10/06 17:58:08 [notice] 1#1: start worker process 47
2024/10/06 17:58:08 [notice] 1#1: start worker process 48
2024/10/06 17:58:08 [notice] 1#1: start worker process 49
2024/10/06 17:58:08 [notice] 1#1: start worker process 50
```
Useful options with this command: 
* `--since=1h`: Prints logs within the last hour
* `--tail=10`: Prints the last 10 lines of logs
* `-f`: Prints logs and follows any new logs
* `-c <container-name>`: Prints logs for a specific container in a pod
* `<file-name>.log`: Ending your command with a file name allows you to output your logs to that file for further refinement

The full documentation for `kubectl logs` can be [found here](kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_logs/).

## Test your Pod
`kubectl debug` creates an ephemeral copy of your target container(s) in a pod. This allows you to then test things in this container without interrupting or impacting your live container(s). Use this command to test a container which has errors or is non-operational. An example is given below: 
```console
kubectl debug -it node/node1 --image=nginx:latest
Creating debugging pod node-debugger-node1-bnm4e with container debugger on node node1
```
Useful options with this command: 
* `-i`: Keep stdin open on the container(s) in the pod
* `-t`: Allocate TTY for debugging the container
* `--image`: Image used to create your ephemeral container.

The full documentation for `kubectl debug` can be [found here](kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_debug/).

## Issue CLI Commands Inside of your Containers
`kubectl exec` allows you to issue CLI commands from inside your containers. This is useful way to check configuration files, validate a volume mounting, or troubleshoot application behaviour. `kube exec` provides a direct line into your containers, and allows you to operate as you would in a traditional linux environment. Write the command you wish to issue after the `--` as shown below:
```console
kubectl exec -it pod1 --container nginxtest -- ls /usr/share/nginx/html
50x.html
index.html
```
Useful options with this command: 
* `-i`: Keep stdin open on the container(s) in the pod
* `-t`: Allocate TTY for debugging the container
* `--container`: The name of the container you are issuing your command in

# Logging and Monitoring Options
Though not directly debugging, logging and monitoring help identify issues in your Kubernetes environment by tracking key metrics. This can identify problems quickly and allows for automation and insight into ensuring your cluster's health and performance.

Kube Native Logging and Monitoring
Prometheus (Grafana?)
Datadog
Calico

Namespaces and Tagging?? Digests??

Other kube commands:
kubectl proxy - 
kubectl port-forward - forwards one or more local ports to a pod. useful for directly connecting to clusters without outside services/endpoints

# Debug Options in Kubernetes

This document covers different debugging options available in Kubernetes. Debugging can help improve performance, availability, and reliability in your Kubernetes environments, as well as identify vulnerabilities and errors. Errors in your Kubernetes environment can sometimes occur due to errors with the applications running in those environments. Always ensure your application is running correctly.Regular audits and debugging can also help prevent future issues from occuring to begin with.

There are multiple layers on which issues can occur in Kubernetes: 
* The Application Layer, which directly hosts applications via containers
* The Object Layer, including pods and services
* The Infrastructure layer, which organizes nodes and networks
* The Control Plane layer

:::note

Both Beginner and Advance debugging options are covered in this document. 

:::

## Application Layer Debugging
?? Is this too basic or out of scope? direct container interaction? `kubectl exec` ideas?

## Object Layer Debugging
The Object Layer covers pods and services in Kubernetes. 

| Command | Description | Utility | More Information |
|--------|----------------|--------|----------------|
| `kubectl get pods` | Lists all existing pods in current namespace. | Use this command to list all pods which are currently running. You can list all pods in a specific namespace with `-n <name_space>`. This can be used to identify any pods that are non-operational. | |
| `kubectl describe pods` | Lists detailed information about pods in your | | |
| `kubectl debug` | Creates a copy of a pod that does terminate when an error is encountered. | | 
| `kubectl logs <pod_name>` | 

## Infrastructure Layer Debugging
The Infrastructure Layer covers nodes and networks in Kubernetes.

| Command | Description | Utility | More Information |
|--------|----------------|--------|----------------|
| `kubectl get nodes` | 
| `kubectl describe node <node_name>` | 
| `kubectl get endpoints <service_name>` | 
| `kubectl get services` 
| `kubectl exec <pod_name> -- nslookup <service_name>` | ??

## Control Plane Layer Debugging
The Control Plane Layer covers cluster management

| Command | Description | Utility | More Information |
|--------|----------------|--------|----------------|
| `kubectl cluster-info dump` | List detailed information about the overall health of your cluster | 
| `kubectl get events` |
